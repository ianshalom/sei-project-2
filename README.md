#Vicarious Adventures
Travel inspired app looking to give people the opportunity to share and also find their next travel holiday destination.

#MVP

- Managed to implement login/signup/logout with cookies.
- Used multer and cloudinary to upload images.
- Able to make nested/multiple queries to the database that displays content
- Implemented quite a bit of flexbox for css.

#Issues

- Could not successfully implement comment box as whenever a user types something into another users' post, the number of posts that user has in total will be the number of times the comment will display despite only making 1 comment.
- Had my homepage initially depend on data from the db to start up which could cause future problems if db had no data.
- Still some issues with css alignments
- Could add an animated timer whenever a user makes an upload as it takes approximately 3 seconds to upload an image.
